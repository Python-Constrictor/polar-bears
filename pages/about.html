                    Contrary to popular belief, the Polar Bears live in the Arctic region throughout the U.S., Canada, Greenland, and Norway. They spend most of their time on sea ice where they camp holes to hunt for seals, create dens for their young and travel to mate.

                    Polar bears have hollow, translucent fur. This allows for it to reflect all visible light, which gives it a white appearance that aids in camouflage. Moreover, the hollow fur also helps them trap heat. They also have a thick layer of fat, called blubber, which acts as additional insulation and food reserves. Additionally, the paws of a polar bear are large and webbed, acting as "snowshoes" and "paddles." This allows for the polar bear to travel on ice and in water.

                    Contrary to most bears and mammals, polar bears do not truly hibernate. As the ice cover is greater during winter months, it is easier for polar bears to hunt so they can store fat reserves for the summer. They also hunt alone because their prey, the ringed seal, is often solitary. Therefore they are less likely to notice approaching predators, making an ambush tactic more efficient.

                <p class="paragraph-text">
                   Polar bears primarily eat seals for their fat content. They hunt by breaking into seal dens, ambushing seals that surfaced to rest on ice, and camping at seal breathing holes.

                    Males reach reproductive age at 8-10 years old, while females reach it at 4-6 years old. Peaking in the months of January and February, ales travel long distances to find a mate and rely on their sense of smell to locate females, which have scent-releasing glands on their paws. Once mutual trust is established between the male and the female, the female will allow the male to mount and fertilize the egg, which develops in October. After 8 months of pregnancy, the female gives birth to a litter of 1-2, and she cares for the cubs for 2.5 years.
