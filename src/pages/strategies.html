                        Even though zoos aren't good for individual polar bears because of a lack of space and stimulation, they are good at raising awareness for polar bears and useful for research purposes.

                        Canada has labelled Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area (which holds the largest subpopulation of polar bears in Canada) a Marine Protected Area, which prohibits industrial activities and wildlife harrasment, ensuring the preservation of that area.

                        The 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears was an agreement made by all countries that have polar bears to take action to protect polar bears. Recently this resulted in the Circumpolar Action Plan, which is an international effort focused on habitat protection and scientific research. It also integrates Indigenous knowledge into conservation strategies.

                        As climate change is the single biggest threat for polar bears, it is important that we reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Countries should commit to stronger climate policies under stricter international frameworks, like the Paris Agreement.

                        Despite existing legal protection for polar bears against hunting, particularly trophy hunting, it is quite evident that those means are mere deterrents. Illegal trophy hunting still exists at a large scale so harsher punishments and stricter enforcement must be implemented.

                        Even though it is a short-term solution, a non-disruptive feeding system for polar bears should be implemented to sustain its current population as more long-term efforts take place.

                        Individually, we can all do our part to save polar bears by reducing our greenhouse emissions. We can do this by using rewnewable energy, carpooling, biking, recyling, and saving energy at home.
