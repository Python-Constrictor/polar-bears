                    The loss of sea ice due to warming temperatures is pushing polar bears further north or inland in search of a stable environment, leading to habitat compression and increased competition.

                    Polar bears primarily hunt seals from the sea ice. As the sea ice melts earlier and forms later, polar bears have shorter hunting seasons and less time to store fat for the summer. Moreover, as they are evolved to store fat from seal blubber, other food sources like berries, eggs or land animals are not suitable replacements.

                    The loss of sea ice also impacts their main prey, the ringed seal, as they need ice to raise their young.

                    Melting permafrost releases toxins that have been trapped for millenia, such as mercury, microbes, and pathogens, which the polar bears have not evolved to defend against.
